# Website Structure & Jekyll Conventions

## Website Structure
- asisaga.com is organized into multiple subdomains, as mentioned in subdomains.json, each implemented as its own submodule within the `Website` folder.
- The Jekyll theme is located in the `theme.asisaga.com` submodule. This theme is applied to all subdomains by GitHub Pages at compile time.
- The structure of the website is documented in `website_structure.json`. Keep this file updated for any structural changes made in the website.

## Jekyll Structure & Components
- Use Jekyll with Liquid templating (no themes required)
- Create reusable UI components in `_includes` folder
- Use `{% include component.html param="value" %}` for parameterized includes
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.) for accessibility and SEO
- Follow component-based architecture: isolated, reusable, maintainable elements
- Break complex UI patterns into smaller, reusable partials
- JavaScript: Place in `/assets/js` folder
- Each Jekyll UI component in `_includes` must have a matching SCSS partial in `/_sass/components/`
- Each HTML page must have a matching SCSS file in `/_sass/pages/` directory
- Each HTML element in a Jekyll UI component or HTML page must have exactly one SCSS class in its respective SCSS file
- **Theme merging:** The `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, and `assets` directories from the `theme.asisaga.com` theme are automatically merged into each subdomain site during the Jekyll site build by GitHub Pages. Do not manually copy these folders into subdomains; update or add components, layouts, styles, or assets in the theme and all subdomains will inherit them on the next build.

# JavaScript Structure & Conventions

## JavaScript Organization
- Each subdomain site must have a `/assets/js/script.js` file, even if only to import shared logic. The `<head>` element in the theme assumes this file exists.
- Shared JavaScript (including Bootstrap logic and utilities) must be placed in the theme's `/assets/js/common.js` file. **Always add new shared scripts to `common.js` in the theme, not directly to HTML files.**
- In each subdomain, `script.js` must import `common.js` from the theme (e.g., `import '/assets/js/common.js'`). Do not duplicate shared JS in subdomains; always import from the theme.
- Place all subdomain-specific JavaScript in the subdomain's `/assets/js` folder, organized by feature or component, using one file per logical unit.
- Use ES6 modules and import/export syntax for modularity and maintainability.
- Use semantic, kebab-case file names for scripts (e.g., `chat-area.js`, `toggle-strip.js`).
- Place page-specific JS in a file named after the page (e.g., `boardroom.js` for the boardroom page).
- All JavaScript must be linted and follow a consistent code style (e.g., StandardJS or Prettier).
- Add descriptive comments and JSDoc for functions and modules.

## JavaScript & Jekyll Integration
- Use `defer` or `type="module"` when including scripts in HTML for non-blocking loading.
- Use data attributes and ARIA attributes for DOM hooks instead of relying on class names.
- Avoid inline JavaScript in HTML or Liquid templates; keep logic in external JS files.
- For interactive UI components, initialize them in a `DOMContentLoaded` or `defer` script block.
- Use event delegation for dynamic content and to minimize event listeners.
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (keyboard, ARIA, focus management).

# SCSS Structure & Components

## Bootstrap Integration
- Bootstrap v5.3.5 with dependencies in `/_sass/bootstrap`in the theme submodule
- Prioritize Bootstrap utilities and components over custom CSS
- Mobile-first: Utilize Bootstrap's responsive grid and utility classes
- Encapsulate Bootstrap inside custom classes in SCSS files
- Customize Bootstrap via SCSS variables rather than overriding styles directly
- Maintain consistent typography and color schemes site-wide
- Follow accessibility guidelines (alt text, ARIA labels, color contrast, etc.)

## SCSS Organization & Hierarchy
- Naming: Use kebab-case for single, descriptive custom classes per element
- Preserve required Jekyll Markdown header in style.scss
- Common SCSS for the theme is kept in the theme's `_sass` directory, with `_common.scss` as the entry point for shared styles.
- Each subdomain maintains its own SCSS in its respective `_sass` directory, with `_main.scss` as the entry point for subdomain-specific styles.
- The theme provides a `style.scss` file in `assets/css`, which is included in the HTML `<head>`.
- `style.scss` loads `_common.scss` from the theme and `_main.scss` from the respective subdomain, ensuring both shared and subdomain-specific styles are applied.
- **All SCSS updates must be made in the appropriate `_sass` directory for the theme or subdomain. Do not edit or add SCSS directly in `assets/css` except for the `style.scss` import file.**

### Partials & Directory Structure
- Name partials with underscore prefix: `_partial-name.scss`
- Organize partials in logical folder hierarchy:
  - `/_sass/assets/base/`: Core theme related styling (variables, typography, utilities)
  - `/_sass/assets/components/`: Reusable UI component styles
  - `/_sass/assets/pages/`: Page-specific layouts
- Required base partials:
  - `_variables.scss`: Define colors, breakpoints, spacing values
  - `_typography.scss`: Font families, sizes, weights, styles
  - `_mixins.scss`: Reusable style patterns and functions
  - `_utilities.scss`: Helper classes that apply single-purpose styling
- Import all partials into `style.scss` in order of dependency
- Group imports by type (base, components, pages) with clear comments
- Import base styles first, then components, then page-specific styles

### Component & Page Styling
- Each Jekyll UI component must have a matching SCSS partial in `/_sass/components/`
- Each HTML page must have a matching SCSS file in `/_sass/pages/` directory
- Nest SCSS classes to match HTML structure hierarchy (applies specifically to page and component SCSS files)
- Use the SCSS parent selector (`&`) appropriately for pseudo-classes and modifier classes
- Limit nesting depth to 3-4 levels to avoid overly specific selectors
- Structure component and page-specific SCSS files to visually represent the DOM hierarchy
- Page-specific and component-specific SCSS should only include or extend Bootstrap code or custom partials, not contain direct CSS property definitions
- Use `@extend`, `@include`, or Bootstrap utility classes within component and page SCSS files rather than writing custom property declarations

### Best Practices
- Keep partials focused on a single concern or component
- Add descriptive comments in SCSS and HTML
