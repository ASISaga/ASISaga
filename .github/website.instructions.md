# Website Structure & Jekyll Conventions

## Website Structure
- asisaga.com is organized into multiple subdomains (e.g., `www`, `realmofagents`, `businessinfinity`), each implemented as its own submodule within the `Website` folder.
- The Jekyll theme is located in the `theme.asisaga.com` submodule. This theme is applied to all subdomains by GitHub Pages at compile time.
- The structure of the website is documented in `website_structure.json`. Keep this file updated for any structural changes made in the website.

## Jekyll Structure & Components
- Use Jekyll with Liquid templating (no themes required)
- Create reusable UI components in `_includes` folder
- Use `{% include component.html param="value" %}` for parameterized includes
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, etc.) for accessibility and SEO
- Follow component-based architecture: isolated, reusable, maintainable elements
- Break complex UI patterns into smaller, reusable partials
- JavaScript: Place in `/assets/js` folder
- Each Jekyll UI component in `_includes` must have a matching SCSS partial in `/assets/css/components/`
- Each HTML page must have a matching SCSS file in `/assets/css/pages/` directory
- Each HTML element in a Jekyll UI component or HTML page must have exactly one SCSS class in its respective SCSS file
- **Subdomain site JavaScript loading:** Each subdomain site includes a `script.js` in its `<head>`, which imports `common.js` from the theme site (`theme.asisaga.com/assets/js`). All shared JS (including Bootstrap logic) must be imported via `common.js` for consistency and maintainability across subdomains.
- **Theme merging:** The `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass`, and `assets` directories from the `theme.asisaga.com` theme are automatically merged into each subdomain site during the Jekyll site build by GitHub Pages. Do not manually copy these folders into subdomains; update or add components, layouts, styles, or assets in the theme and all subdomains will inherit them on the next build.


# SCSS Structure & Components

## Bootstrap Integration
- Bootstrap v5.3.5 with dependencies in `assets/css/bootstrap`
- Prioritize Bootstrap utilities and components over custom CSS
- Mobile-first: Utilize Bootstrap's responsive grid and utility classes
- Encapsulate Bootstrap inside custom classes in SCSS files
- Customize Bootstrap via SCSS variables rather than overriding styles directly
- Maintain consistent typography and color schemes site-wide
- Follow accessibility guidelines (alt text, ARIA labels, color contrast, etc.)

## SCSS Organization & Hierarchy
- Naming: Use kebab-case for single, descriptive custom classes per element
- Central styling: `/assets/css/style.scss` (imports only, no direct code)
- Preserve required Jekyll Markdown header in style.scss
- Common SCSS for the theme is kept in the theme's `_sass` directory, with `_common.scss` as the entry point for shared styles.
- Each subdomain maintains its own SCSS in its respective `_sass` directory, with `_main.scss` as the entry point for subdomain-specific styles.
- The theme provides a `style.scss` file in `assets/css`, which is included in the HTML `<head>`.
- `style.scss` loads `_common.scss` from the theme and `_main.scss` from the respective subdomain, ensuring both shared and subdomain-specific styles are applied.
- **All SCSS updates must be made in the appropriate `_sass` directory for the theme or subdomain. Do not edit or add SCSS directly in `assets/css` except for the `style.scss` import file.**
- **All SCSS files in the theme and all subdomains must use SCSS's modern module system: use `@use` and `@forward` instead of `@import`. Refactor any legacy `@import` statements to use `@use`/`@forward` for modularity, maintainability, and compatibility with future Sass versions.**

### Partials & Directory Structure
- Name partials with underscore prefix: `_partial-name.scss`
- Organize partials in logical folder hierarchy:
  - `/assets/css/base/`: Core styling (variables, typography, utilities)
  - `/assets/css/components/`: Reusable UI component styles
  - `/assets/css/pages/`: Page-specific layouts
- Required base partials:
  - `_variables.scss`: Define colors, breakpoints, spacing values
  - `_typography.scss`: Font families, sizes, weights, styles
  - `_mixins.scss`: Reusable style patterns and functions
  - `_utilities.scss`: Helper classes that apply single-purpose styling
- Import all partials into `style.scss` in order of dependency
- Group imports by type (base, components, pages) with clear comments
- Import base styles first, then components, then page-specific styles

### Component & Page Styling
- Each Jekyll UI component must have a matching SCSS partial in `/assets/css/components/`
- Each HTML page must have a matching SCSS file in `/assets/css/pages/` directory
- Nest SCSS classes to match HTML structure hierarchy (applies specifically to page and component SCSS files)
- Use the SCSS parent selector (`&`) appropriately for pseudo-classes and modifier classes
- Limit nesting depth to 3-4 levels to avoid overly specific selectors
- Structure component and page-specific SCSS files to visually represent the DOM hierarchy
- Page-specific and component-specific SCSS should only include or extend Bootstrap code or custom partials, not contain direct CSS property definitions
- Use `@extend`, `@include`, or Bootstrap utility classes within component and page SCSS files rather than writing custom property declarations

### Best Practices
- Keep partials focused on a single concern or component
- Add descriptive comments in SCSS and HTML
