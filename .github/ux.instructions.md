# UX Design Principles for ASI Saga

## Narrative & World-Building

- Open each document with the saga's high-level premise: the evolving interplay between human creativity and artificial superintelligence.
- Define core archetypes (e.g., the Seeker, the Catalyst ASI, the Guardian of Fixed Paradigms) with their motivations, stakes, and transformational arcs.
- Contextualize scenes in time and space: describe the philosophical backdrop, key locales, and world-building rules that shape user choices.
- Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon unless it is defined in context.
- Provide visual or structural cues (e.g., section dividers, icons, or color coding) to help users quickly orient themselves within the narrative.
- **Information Architecture**: Structure content hierarchically with clear headings, logical flow, and scannable format.
- **Cognitive Load**: Limit information density per screen/section to prevent overwhelming users.
- **Mental Models**: Align narrative structure with users' existing understanding of storytelling conventions.

## User Journey & Interaction Flows

- Map the user's journey as a series of narrative "nodes," each with goals, conflicts, and decision points that tie back to ASI Saga's themes.
- For each node, outline primary actions, branching options, and reflective feedback loops (e.g., system prompts, in-story consequences, meta-commentary).
- Annotate microinteractions: emotional tone, pacing cues, and dynamic feedback (visual, textual, or auditory).
- Ensure all interactive elements are clearly labeled and provide immediate, meaningful feedback.
- Design for progressive disclosure: reveal complexity as users progress, avoiding overwhelming them at the start.
- Support undo/redo or backtracking where possible, so users feel safe exploring different narrative paths.
- **Error Prevention**: Anticipate user mistakes and provide clear guidance before errors occur.
- **Affordances**: Make interactive elements visually obvious through appropriate styling and hover states.
- **Flow State**: Maintain optimal challenge-to-skill ratio to keep users engaged without frustration.
- **Confirmation Patterns**: Use appropriate confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions.

## Design System & Modular Components

- Name and catalog recurring UX components (for example, ScenarioCanvas, ReflectionModal, DialoguePrompt).
- Recommend spacing scales, typography hierarchies, and color palettes that mirror the saga's tonal shifts—from contemplative to climactic.
- Encourage reusable templates for user-driven experiments: world-building sheets, persona profiles, and choice-impact matrices.
- Maintain visual consistency across all components; use a shared design system for colors, icons, and spacing.
- Ensure all components are responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Use accessible color contrasts and font sizes for readability.
- **Design Tokens**: Establish consistent values for spacing, colors, typography, and animations.
- **Component States**: Define clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states for all interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Use mobile-first approach with breakpoints that serve actual user needs.
- **Performance**: Optimize component loading and rendering for smooth user experience.

## Philosophical Depth & Tone

- Infuse each section with probing questions or reflective prompts that invite users to challenge fixed constraints.
- Maintain a warm, engaged voice that balances technical precision with poetic insight—mirroring ASI Saga's blend of rigor and wonder.
- Tie design decisions back to the saga's core message: catalyzing boundless creative abundance.
- Encourage user reflection and self-expression through open-ended prompts and journaling opportunities.
- **Emotional Design**: Consider the emotional journey and design moments of delight, surprise, and satisfaction.
- **Personality**: Maintain consistent brand voice that reflects ASI Saga's unique blend of humanity and technology.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Ensure all diagrams and conceptual images include descriptive alt text that captures both visual layout and philosophical intent.
- Use plain language for complex ideas; supplement with tooltips or sidebars for advanced readers.
- Design for keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility, especially within interactive scenario flows.
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information; use patterns, icons, or text labels as well.
- Test interactive flows with users of diverse backgrounds and abilities, and iterate based on feedback.
- Provide options for users to adjust text size, contrast, and pacing to suit their needs.
- **WCAG Compliance**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum, strive for AAA where possible.
- **Inclusive Design**: Consider diverse abilities, cultures, languages, and technological contexts.
- **Focus Management**: Ensure logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect users' motion preferences and provide alternatives to animations.

---

## Usability & Testing

- **User Testing**: Conduct regular usability testing with diverse user groups.
- **Analytics**: Track user behavior patterns and identify pain points in the experience.
- **A/B Testing**: Test different approaches to critical user flows and interactions.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Regularly assess designs against established usability principles.
- **Task Analysis**: Break down complex user goals into smaller, manageable steps.

---

## Performance & Technical Excellence

- **Loading States**: Provide meaningful feedback during content loading and processing.
- **Error Handling**: Design helpful error messages that guide users toward resolution.
- **Offline Experience**: Consider how the experience degrades gracefully without connectivity.
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure consistent experience across different devices and browsers.

---

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update UX patterns based on user feedback and analytics.
- Document all design decisions and rationale for future contributors.
- Foster a culture of empathy, curiosity, and experimentation in all UX work.
- **Design System Evolution**: Continuously refine and expand the design system based on new needs.
- **User Feedback Loops**: Establish channels for ongoing user input and feature requests.
- **Accessibility Audits**: Conduct regular accessibility reviews and testing with assistive technologies.
