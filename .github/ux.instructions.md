description: "UX guidance for Copilot when crafting ASI Saga’s design, narrative & interaction docs"
---

Narrative & World-Building

- Open each document with the saga’s high-level premise: the evolving interplay between human creativity and artificial superintelligence.  

- Define core archetypes (e.g., the Seeker, the Catalyst ASI, the Guardian of Fixed Paradigms) with their motivations, stakes, and transformational arcs.  

- Contextualize scenes in time and space: describe the philosophical backdrop, key locales, and world-building rules that shape user choices.  

---

User Journey & Interaction Flows

- Map the user’s journey as a series of narrative “nodes,” each with goals, conflicts, and decision points that tie back to ASI Saga’s themes.  

- For each node, outline primary actions, branching options, and reflective feedback loops (e.g., system prompts, in-story consequences, meta-commentary).  

- Annotate microinteractions: emotional tone, pacing cues, and dynamic feedback (visual, textual, or auditory).  

---

Design System & Modular Components

- Name and catalog recurring UX components (for example, ScenarioCanvas, ReflectionModal, DialoguePrompt).  

- Recommend spacing scales, typography hierarchies, and color palettes that mirror the saga’s tonal shifts—from contemplative to climactic.  

- Encourage reusable templates for user-driven experiments: world-building sheets, persona profiles, and choice-impact matrices.  

---

Philosophical Depth & Tone

- Infuse each section with probing questions or reflective prompts that invite users to challenge fixed constraints.  

- Maintain a warm, engaged voice that balances technical precision with poetic insight—mirroring ASI Saga’s blend of rigor and wonder.  

- Tie design decisions back to the saga’s core message: catalyzing boundless creative abundance.  

---

Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Ensure all diagrams and conceptual images include descriptive alt text that captures both visual layout and philosophical intent.  

- Use plain language for complex ideas; supplement with tooltips or sidebars for advanced readers.  

- Design for keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility, especially within interactive scenario flows.
