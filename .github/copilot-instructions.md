asisaga.github.io is a static html website.
It is built using bootstrap, so avoid raw css as much as possible. Use cards for code reuse.
It uses Jekyll static site generator, so use liquid templating language, wherever possible. However, don't use Jekyll themes.
The site would be deployed on github pages, so local instalation of Jekyll is not required.
Use /assets/js folder for JavaScript code.
